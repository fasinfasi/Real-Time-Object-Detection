## 🔎 Object Detection with YOLOv8 + OpenCV + PyTorch + GPU 🔍
This project is a real-time object detection system built using YOLOv8, OpenCV, PyTorch, and the Supervision library. It leverages GPU acceleration to detect and track multiple object classes from videos efficiently.

### 🚀 Features

✅ Real-time object detection using YOLOv8

⚡ GPU-accelerated inference using PyTorch (CUDA)

📹 Supports video file input

🧠 Tracks and detects multiple object classes

🧰 Visualizes detection results with bounding boxes and labels

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Model: YOLOv8
Libraries:
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Supervision
- Hardware: Tested with GPU (NVIDIA CUDA)

### 🧪 Tested Scenarios
##### The model was tested with various video clips, including:

1. Street traffic (cars, pedestrians)
2. Public areas (traggic light, people, animals)
3. Fast scenes (Flying Airplanes, Cars)

It consistently identified and tracked multiple object types accurately.
